# work-day-scheduler
This is a simple day planer for the hours of 9 to 5. 
There are three colors to show passage of time through the day. Grey means it is past the current hour, red is current hour and green is future hour.
User is able to schedule things hourly and save it to local storage so that the changes will show when page is reloaded.
